# Sudoku Game + Solver

Pygame is required for this installation
```bash
import pygame

Introduction
Sudoku is an all-time favorite puzzle game with a 9x9 board. Our goal is to place numbers 1-9 in the grid with the following contraints:
* Different numbers within a row
* Different numbers within a column
* Different numbers within a 3x3 section of the board.

A Backtracking algorithm was used in the solver


Getting Started
The following files should be in your working directory
```bash
import pygame
```

In order to play this game you must have python 3.9 or 3.8 installed in your computer. Furthermore, you may also have pygame already set up and install in your computer. If you don't have these options, you can use the terminal option prompt from the user after running solver.py

Usage
solver.py will prompt the user what to do. The program will also be input validating to allow for proper run.

If using the optional GUI.py, make sure to install pygame first.

Further Updates
* Full functioning playable game 
* Timer and scoreboard
* Ability to edge detect and scan a sudoku image as input.
